      1. Play 1-on-1 or with teams of 2. Gather the players for your beer pong game and separate to opposite sides of your beer pong table. Sides can include 1 or 2 players each. If you're playing in teams of 2, take turns throwing the ball each time you get a turn. Beer pong can be played on a table of any size, but if you want to make your own, tables are traditionally 8 feet (2.4 m) long x 4 feet (1.2 m) wide.
      <br>
      <br>
      2. Fill twenty 16 oz (450 g) plastic cups halfway with beer or water. Place ten 16 oz (450 g) cups on each side of the table. Then, pour beer into the cups until each one has been filled about halfway. To drink more responsibly and avoid spreading germs, consider filling each cup up with water instead. Then, take a drink from your own beer can each time a shot is made.
      <br>
      <br>
      3. Fill a bucket with clean water to rinse balls before throwing. While sanitation isn't exactly the cornerstone of beer pong, nobody wants to drink a tainted cup of beer. Have a bucket of clean water handy so players can rinse their balls before throwing and keep paper towels nearby to soak up spills.
      <br>
      <br>
      4. Arrange the plastic cups into a 10-cup triangle at each end of the table. Assemble the triangles so each top point is facing the opposing team. There will be 1 cup in the first row, 2 in the second row, 3 in the third row, and the base of the triangle will have 4 cups. Pack the cups cups closely together so they're all touching. Do not tilt the cups.
      <br>
      <br>
      5. Determine who goes first. Many games are started by a member of each team playing rock, paper, scissors. Winners go first. Another variation to choose who goes first is playing “eye-to-eye.” To do this, try to make a cup while maintaining eye contact with your opponent. The first player to land a cup goes first. You can also flip a coin.
    </p>
    <p class="gameplay-text">
      1. Take turns throwing the balls into cups. Each team gets to throw one ball per turn. The goal is to throw the ball into a cup of the opposing team. Throw the ball directly into a cup or bounce a ball off of the table into a cup. Just keep your elbows behind the table when you throw, otherwise the point won't count!
      <br>
      <br>
      2. Drink according to where the ball lands. When the ball lands in a cup, drink the beer in that cup. If you're playing in teams of two, alternate the drinking between you and your partner—if you drink the first cup, let your partner drink the second. Set the cup aside once you drink it.
      <br>
      <br>
      3. "Re-rack” the cups into a diamond when 4 only cups remain. Once 6 cups of beer have been drunk on your side of the table, restack the remaining 4 into a diamond shape. This process, called “re-racking,” will make shooting easier for everyone.
      <br>
      <br>
      4. Re-rack the last 2 cups into a single file line. Once 8 cups have been drunk on either side, arrange the last 2 cups into a vertical line, with the back cup approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edge of the table.
      <br>
      <br>
      5. Keep playing until one team has no cups remaining. Continue tossing the ball, one side at a time, until one player or team has sunk a ball into all of their opponent's cups. The first player or side to do this wins the game.
