      Setup
    </h3>
    <p class="setup-text">
      1. Play 1-on-1 or with teams of 2. Gather the players for your beer pong game and separate to opposite sides of your beer pong table. Sides can include 1 or 2 players each. If you're playing in teams of 2, take turns throwing the ball each time you get a turn. Beer pong can be played on a table of any size, but if you want to make your own, tables are traditionally 8 feet (2.4 m) long x 4 feet (1.2 m) wide.
      <br>
      <br>
      2. Fill twenty 16 oz (450 g) plastic cups halfway with beer or water. Place ten 16 oz (450 g) cups on each side of the table. Then, pour beer into the cups until each one has been filled about halfway. To drink more responsibly and avoid spreading germs, consider filling each cup up with water instead. Then, take a drink from your own beer can each time a shot is made.
      <br>
      <br>
      3. Fill a bucket with clean water to rinse balls before throwing. While sanitation isn't exactly the cornerstone of beer pong, nobody wants to drink a tainted cup of beer. Have a bucket of clean water handy so players can rinse their balls before throwing and keep paper towels nearby to soak up spills.
      <br>
      <br>
      4. Arrange the plastic cups into a 10-cup triangle at each end of the table. Assemble the triangles so each top point is facing the opposing team. There will be 1 cup in the first row, 2 in the second row, 3 in the third row, and the base of the triangle will have 4 cups. Pack the cups cups closely together so they're all touching. Do not tilt the cups.
      <br>
      <br>
      5. Determine who goes first. Many games are started by a member of each team playing rock, paper, scissors. Winners go first. Another variation to choose who goes first is playing “eye-to-eye.” To do this, try to make a cup while maintaining eye contact with your opponent. The first player to land a cup goes first. You can also flip a coin.
