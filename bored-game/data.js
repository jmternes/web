        <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br><br>
        1. <em>Objective:</em><br><br> Players aim to get a hand totaling as close to 31 points as possible in the same suit or to have the highest hand at the table to avoid the penalty.<br><br>
        2. <em>Setup:</em><br><br> Each player starts with three cards, and one card is placed face up to start the discard pile, with the rest of the deck forming the draw pile.<br><br>
        3. <em>Playing:</em><br><br> On their turn, a player may draw the top card from either the draw pile or the discard pile and then must discard one card. The aim is to improve the total value of one's hand in the same suit.<br><br>
        4. <em>Knocking:</em><br><br> A player can end the round by 'knocking' instead of playing their turn. All other players then get one more turn to improve their hands.<br><br>

Face cards are worth 10 points, aces are worth 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value. The player with the lowest hand value after a knock or when the deck is depleted loses the round and receives a penalty.<br><br>

        Nim is a mathematical strategy game for two players. It involves a number of objects (such as matches, coins, stones, or sugar packets) arranged in rows. Players take turns removing objects, with the goal of being the last to take an object.<br><br><br>
        <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br><br>
        1. <em>Objective:</em><br><br> The aim is to force the opponent to take the last object.<br><br>
        2. <em>Setup:</em><br><br> Objects are arranged in several rows, with the number of objects per row varying. The exact setup can vary, but a common one is three rows containing 3, 5, and 7 objects, respectively.<br><br>
        3. <em>Playing:</em><br><br> Players take turns removing any number of objects from a single row. At least one object must be taken, but a player may take as many as they wish from the chosen row.<br><br>
        4. <em>Strategy:</em><br><br> Winning at Nim requires strategic planning. Players must think ahead to leave their opponent in a position where they have no choice but to take the last object. The game involves mathematical underpinnings, particularly the concept of Nim-sums, which can determine the best moves.<br><br>
        5. <em>Winning:</em><br><br> The game ends when all objects have been taken. The player who takes the last object is the loser in traditional rules, but variations exist where taking the last object makes a player the winner.`

          Seven Card Stud is one of the oldest forms of poker, where players are dealt seven cards throughout the hand, but only the best five-card hand possible for each player is used to determine the winner.<br><br><br>
          <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br><br>
          1. <em>Objective:</em><br><br> The goal is to create the best five-card poker hand from the seven cards you are dealt.<br><br>
          2. <em>Setup:</em><br><br> Each player pays an ante and receives two cards face down (hole cards) and one card face up (door card).<br><br>
          3. <em>Betting Rounds:</em><br><br> There are five betting rounds. The first round of betting starts with the player with the highest door card. Subsequent rounds follow the poker betting structure.<br><br>
          4. <em>The Play:</em><br><br> Players receive three more face-up cards (the fourth, fifth, and sixth cards) and one final card face down (the seventh card), with a betting round after each.<br><br>
          5. <em>Showdown:</em><br><br> Players reveal their hands in a showdown, with the best five-card hand winning the pot.<br><br>

          <strong>Variants:</strong><br><br>1. <em>High-Low Split:</em> In some variations, the pot is split between the best high hand and the best low hand.

Aces are low, and straights and flushes do not count against the hand.<br><br>3. <em>Roll Your Own:</em> A variation where players choose which of their cards are face up and which are face down, adding an extra layer of strategy to the game.`

        <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br><br>
        1. <em>Objective:</em><br><br> To win, players must be the first to play all of their cards by matching them to a central pile by either number or suit.<br><br>
